# Chaos & noise
<b>Chaos &amp; noise</b> is an implementation that suggests by experiment that the universe is deterministic. Initially, the experiment was used to show why there are limits in predicting the behavior of physical systems. To show this, noise is introduced inside three chaotic systems, which inevitably leads to different results each time over longer periods of time. Thus, it is shown that the three chaotic systems can be predictable until a certain moment, in which the noise starts to build different and unpredictable trajectories for the three systems. The subject is openly described in the book entitled <i>Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Theory and Implementation</i> in the chapter <i>Philosophical transactions</i>.
